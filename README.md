# Calculator
It is a calculator in which you can introduce an operation (as a string) and it will give you back the result

The four operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

IMPORTANT!!!
This calculator does not support parentheses at the moment. However, you can introduce "1--2" and it will interpret it as "1 - (-2)"
For me, it is more efficient and I do not need to search for parentheses at every moment. I am planning to use it instead
of the Windows one.

HOW TO USE IT:
This needs to be used with a console. Personally, I created a .txt file and wrote the following:
- Start of .txt file
@echo off
java -jar <location_of_your_project_in_your_local_machine>\build\libs\SystemIn-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
- End of .txt file
Then you just need to change <Name_of_your_file>.txt to <Name_of_your_file>.bat

PD: The original purpose of this project was to learn Kotlin pragmatically. Therefore, I am not an expert and I continue learning about this language.

Thank you for reading it.
